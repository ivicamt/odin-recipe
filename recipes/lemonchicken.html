            <li>Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).</li>
            <li>Rinse the whole chicken inside and out with cold water and pat it dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Cut one of the lemons into slices and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the minced garlic, olive oil, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.</li>
            <li>Rub the chicken all over, including inside the cavity, with the prepared marinade, ensuring it is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Place the lemon slices inside the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Truss the chicken (optional) - tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help it cook more evenly.</li>

            <li>Squeeze the juice of the second lemon all over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken broth or water into the bottom of the roasting pan to keep the chicken moist during cooking.</li>
            <li>Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) and the skin is golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving.</li>
            <li>Serve the lemon garlic roasted chicken with your favorite sides like roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</li>
