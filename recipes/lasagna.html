    <h1>The Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or turkey</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>24 ounces (680g) marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>6-8 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Instructions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef or turkey until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the marinara sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella, and half of the grated Parmesan.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 2-3 lasagna noodles on top, covering the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spoon half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles and spread it evenly. Top with another layer of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Serve and enjoy your quick and delicious refor lasagna!</p>
